# Expense tracker

 Time to manage my finances...

# How to use
Type the following command
```console
dotnet run <special command>
```

Special command:
- add  
- update  
- delete  
- list  
- export  

# Requirements

Application should run from the command line and should have the following features::

- Users can add an expense with a description and amount. ✅
- Users can update an expense. ✅
- Users can delete an expense. ✅
- Users can view all expenses. ✅
- Users can view a summary of all expenses. ✅
- Users can view a summary of expenses for a specific month (of current year). [Work in progress]

Extra features:

- Add expense categories and allow users to filter expenses by category. [Work in progress]
- Allow users to set a budget for each month and show a warning when the user exceeds the budget. [Work in progress]
- Allow users to export expenses to a CSV file. ✅

My ideas: 

- Actual GUI instead of CLI, nothing wrong with the CLIs tho..

This project was inspired from [this](https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker) part of a roadmap and used for practice and probably better money management.
